coreBOS Composer post-Install script
=======

**core Business Operating System Composer helper script**

This project implements a post-install script which you can add to the composer download process (composer.json) to have your coreBOS modules and extension copied into the correct location for production. This permits mass distribution of modules and extensions and is a fundamental corner stone for the **Perspectives initiative** which permits us to easily convert a normal coreBOS into a powerful verticalization for a certain market segment.

This project is part of the coreBOS packaging system. You can find additional information on it's usage in the [coreBOS documentation wiki](http://corebos.org/documentation) and, in particular, in the [coreBOS Packaging Page](http://corebos.org/documentation/doku.php?id=en:devel:packagemodules).
